# Project  - *Covid Population Disparities*

**Covid Population Disparities** We created a semi-interactive dashboard using jupyter notebook with the created notebook we were able to host it using *Voila* on a local host

## Introduction
**Covid-19**-COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a viral infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and is currently a World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic. As of September 2020, over 30 million people had been infected globally with over 1 million deaths

## Data Sources
* Atlanta county geojson data: https://opendata.atlantaregional.com/datasets/53ca7db14b8f4a9193c1883247886459_67
* Georgia Department of Health Covid-19 data:https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report
## Goals

The following goals were completed:

* [X] Obtain **Population** , **Income**, and **Covid-19** data for the city of **Atlanta**
* [X] Merge datasets together
* [X] Complete **SIR** modeling using Python
* [X] Create **Heatmap** framework using **Jupyter Notebook**
* [X] Create  **VScode file** containing **SIR model** , **Heatmap** , **Normalized data scatterplots**
## Walkthrough
* **SIR model**- Model to show the spread of disease
* **Heatmap** - Generate choropleth map using georgia county FIPS codes displaying Covid-19 Deaths heatmap, Covid-19 Cases heatmap, Population heatmap, and Average Household income heatmap
* **Normalized data scatterplots**- 

## Possible Additions

Here are some possible additions that can be added to our project:

* **Heatmap interactivity** -add more interactivity to heatmaps to allow the graphs to display selected counties
* **Real-time public transit data** - possibly adding a fuctionality to pull realtime public transit data in georgia using MARTA(Georgia public transit) API key
* **SIR model** - Continue to add realistic data into the model to predict how likely what areas in atlanta may need more resources
